<p>11. Hasn't the Catholic Church changed its doctrines through the years?</p>
<p>Protestants often accuse the Catholic Church of changing its doctrines, or inventing new ones. Usually they are confusing Church doctrines with Church disciplines. A doctrine is an unchangeable truth revealed by God - such as the Virgin Birth, while a discipline is a changeable regulation - like the priest facing the people instead of the altar during the Mass.</p>
<p>The Catholic Church teaches there can be no new doctrines since the death of the last apostle. The Apostolic deposit of faith was delivered once and for all (Jude 3). However, the eternal truths of God must be lived out in different times, cultures, and places. Church disciplines which help us live out these truths are therefore adapted as conditions in the Church change.</p>
<p>We must also remember that doctrines can develop, in the sense of being under- stood more fully and made more explicit. These fuller insights are passed on by the Church through its teaching office (Magisterium). This is not invention, but proper growth. Whenever a non- Catholic insists that the Catholic Church has changed its doctrines, you can be sure that he has either confused a discipline with a doctrine, or else mistaken true doctrinal development for a new invention.</p>
<p>12. Why does the Catholic Church forbid its priests to marry? Doesn't St. Paul call forbidding marriage a "doctrine of demons" (1 Tim 4:1-3)?</p>
<p>The Catholic Church does not forbid marriage; the Church upholds the great dignity of marriage. Marriage is considered a holy sacrament that symbolizes the union of Christ with His Church (Eph 5:21-33). The Church only forbids marriage, as a matter of discipline, to those men who choose to become priests. No one is forced into the priesthood. Those who wish to become priests are asked to renounce sex for the sake of the kingdom of God. Remember, Jesus praises those who would freely renounce sex for the kingdom of God (Mt 19:12).</p>
<p>St. Paul's denunciation of those who forbid marriage applies to those who reject marriage entirely, as though it were evil in itself. St. Paul is warning against a false spirituality which holds that any part of God's good creation - including marriage - is evil (1 Tim 4:3-4).</p>
<p>St. Paul obviously is not condemning celibacy. St. Paul was himself single (1 Cor 7:8), just as Jesus was. St. Paul strongly recommends celibacy for those who would devote themselves entirely to the ministry:</p>
