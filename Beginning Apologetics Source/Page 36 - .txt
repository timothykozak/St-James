<p>state of unrepented mortal (deadly) sin go directly to hell. What about the middle sort of people: those who die in the state of grace, but with venial sin or with unpaid reparation due to forgiven sin? They do not merit hell: they are still in the state of grace; yet they are not pure enough for heaven, where "nothing unclean shall enter" (Rev 21:27).</p>
<p>Is Purgatory reasonable?</p>
<p>In 1769, James Boswell asked Samuel Johnson:</p>
<div class="well">"What do you think, Sir, of Purgatory, as believed by the Roman Catholics?"</div>
<p>Samuel Johnson replied:</p>
<div class="well">Why, Sir, it is a very harmless doctrine. They are of the opinion that the generality of mankind are neither so obstinately wicked as to deserve everlasting punishment, nor so good as to merit being admitted into the society of blessed spirits; and therefore that God is graciously pleased to allow a middle state, where they may be purified by certain degrees of suffering. You see, Sir, there is nothing unreasonable in this.</div>
<p>Though not a Catholic, Johnson could see that Purgatory was perfectly reasonable.</p>
<p>Another non-Catholic who believed in Purgatory was C. S. Lewis. In his Letters To Malcom: Chiefly on Prayer, he writes:</p>
<div class="well">Our souls demand Purgatory, don't they? Would it not break the heart if God said to us, "It is true, my son, that your breath smells and your rags drip with mud and slime, but we are charitable here and no one will upbraid you with these things, nor draw away from you. Enter into the joy"?  Should we not reply, "With submission, sir, and if there is no objection, I'd rather cleaned first." "It may hurt, you know."   "Even so, sir."</div>
<p>What does the Bible say about this?</p>
<p>God is perfect holiness.</p>
<div class="well">Is 6:3: And one [seraphim] called to another and said: "Holy, holy holy is the Lord of hosts".</div>
<p>We are called to that same holiness.</p>
<div class="well">Mt 5:48: You, therefore, mm be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.</div>
<div class="well">1 Pet 1:15-16: as he wh called you is holy, be holy yourselves ii all your conduct; since it is written "You shall be holy, for I am holy".</div>
<p>Without perfect holiness, we cannot God in heaven.</p>
<div class="well">Heb 12:14: Strive for peace with all men, and for the holiness without which no one will see the Lord.</div>
<div class="well">Rev 21:27: nothing unclean shall enter it [heaven].</div>
<p>What happens to the faithful who die without perfect holiness or with sin that is not deadly?
The biblical, logical, and historical is Purgatory.</p>
<p>Purgatory comes from the verb " meaning "to purify or cleanse." We s keep this notion of purification in when explaining this doctrine.</p>
