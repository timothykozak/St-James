Various bishops developed lists of inspired books:
Mileto, Bishop of Sardis, around AD 175
St. Irenaeus, Bishop of Lyons, AD 185
Eusebius, Bishop of Caesarea, around AD 325
Pope Damasus in AD 382, prompted by the Council of ROme, wrote a decree listing the present OT and NT canon of 73 books.
The Council of Hippo (in North Africa) in AD 393, approved the present OT and NT canon of 73 books.
The Council of Carthage (in North Africa) in AD 397, approved the same OT and NT canon. This is the council which many Protestants take as the authority for the NT canon of books.
Pope St. Innocent I (401-417) in AD 4051 approved the 73-book canon and closed the canon of the Bible.
The canon of the Bible was officially determined in the late fourth century by Catholic councils and Catholic popes. Until the canon was decided, there was much debate. Some were of the opinion that certain canonical books - Hebrews, Jude, Revelation, 2 Peter - were not inspired, while others held that certain noncanonical books - Shepherd of Hermas, Gospels of Peter and Thomas, the letters of Barnabas and Clement - were inspired. The formal Church decision settled the matter for the next 1100 years. Not until the Reformation was there any more debate about the contents of the Bible.
Historically, the Catholic Church used her authority to determine which books belong to the Bible, and to assure us that everything in the Bible is inspired. Apart from the Church, we simply have no way of knowing either truth.
