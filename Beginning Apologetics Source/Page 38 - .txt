<p>St. Peter is describing a temporary state for disobedient souls who were eventually saved. At the very least, it proves that a third state can exist besides heaven and hell. At the very most, it proves the Catholic doctrine of Purgatory.</p>
<p>The clearest affirmation of the existence of Purgatory comes from the Greek Septuagint: the Old Testament Scriptures used by Christ, all the NT writers, and the councils of Hippo and Carthage (which authoritatively determined the "canon" of inspired books of the Bible).</p>
<div class="well">2 Maccabees 12:44-45: For if he were not expecting that those who had fallen would rise again, it would have been superfluous and foolish to pray for the dead. But if he was looking to the splendid reward that is laid up for those who fall asleep in godliness, it was a holy and pious thought. Therefore he made atonement for the dead, that they might be delivered from their sin.</div>
<p>It is impossible to aid souls in heaven (they have no need), and equally impossible to aid souls in hell (they have no hope). Praying for the dead presumes souls in a middle state where atonement for sin can be made.</p>
<p>This passage from Maccabees is a PROOF text. It explicitly affirms an intermediate state where the faithful departed make atonement for their sins. 2 Maccabees was so contrary to the "justification by faith alone" theology of the Reformers that Martin Luther chose to remove it (along with six other books) from the Old Testament.</p>
<p>This takes us back to the question of the canon of the Bible: How do we know which books really constitute the Bible? By whose authority do we trust that the books upon which we stake our eternal salvation really are inspired?</p>
<p>Do we rely on the private judgment of a renegade priest, Luther, who also wanted to throw out Esther, James and Revelation, and who thought nothing of adding a word to his translation of Romans?</p>
<p>Or, do we accept the divinely-protected judgment of the Catholic Church who used her authority around the year AD 400 to determine the official canon of the Bible.  This is the same Bible (less seven books) used by Protestants to attack the very authority of the Church who gave it to them.</p>
<p>Even if 2 Maccabees is rejected as Scripture, there can be no doubt tht, as history, the book accurately reflects the religious character of the Jews of the second century BC. A little more than one hundred years before Christ, Jews prayed for their dead (and still do today).</p>
<p>In fact, some of the earliest Christian liturgies (worship services) include prayers for the dead. Ancient Christian tomb inscriptions from the second and third centuries frequently contain an appeal for prayer for the dead.37 This practice makes sense only if</p>


37 The epitaph of Abercius [AD 1801 reads: "The citizens of a prominent city, I erected this while I lived, that I might have a resting place for my body. Abercius is my name, a disciple of the chaste shepherd who feeds his sheep on the mountains and in the fields, who has great eyes surveying everywhere, who taught me the faithful writings of life. Standing by, I, Abercius ordered this to be inscribed; truly I was in my seventy second year.  May everyone who is in accord with this and who understands it pray for Abercius" (Jurgens, #187).
