<p>Protestants reject apostolic succession in general and the teaching authority of the bishop of Rome in particular. You should focus on papal authority because it has strong support in Scripture, and it can be easily traced historically.</p>
<p>Scripture</p>
<p>In the OT, when God established His Covenant with the nation of Israel, He provided for a living, continuing authority in the Mosaic priesthood (see 2 Chr 19:11; Mal 2:7.) This authority did not end when the OT Scripture was written; rather, it continued as the safeguard and authentic interpreter of Sacred Scripture.</p>
<p>When Christ established His Church, the New Israel, He set up a living, continuing authority to teach, govern, and sanctify in His name. This living authority is called "Apostolic" because it began with the twelve Apostles and continued with their successors.</p>
<p>It was this Apostolic authority that would preserve and authentically interpret the revelation of Jesus Christ. This same Apostolic authority determined the canon of the Bible, and will preserve the teachings of Jesus Christ in all their fullness, and uncorrupted from error, until the end of time.<p>
<p>Among the twelve Apostles, St. Peter is clearly the head. Know Matthew 16:13-19 well:</p>
<blockquote>And I tell you, you are Peter [Rock], and on this rock I will build my church, and the powers of death shall not prevail against it. I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven (verses 18-19).</blockquote>


18 Many Protestants argue that Jesus is not building His Church on Peter by pointing out that, in the Greek text, the word used for Peter is Petros, a masculine noun, while the word used for rock is petra, a feminine noun. Petros means "small stone," while petra means "massive rock." They claim, therefore, that the "massive rock" (petra) upon which Christ will build His Church must not refer to Peter the "small stone" (Petros) but rather to Peter's profession of faith or to Jesus. However, Jesus spoke Aramaic, which leaves no room for the Greek Petros/petra distinction. In Aramaic, the word for rock is kepha. What Christ said was, "You are Kepha (Rock) and upon this kepha (rock) I will build my Church." In Aramaic, the identification of Peter as the rock is clear.
Why does the Greek use two different words for Peter and the rock? Because the Greek word for rock, petra, is feminine. It would not be appropriate to give a man a feminine name. So the translator gave petra a masculine ending and rendered it Petros. Since petros could also mean "small stone," some of the original word-play was lost. But no early Church Father, including those who spoke Greek as their mother-tongue, ever saw a distinction between Peter and the rock. They teach that Peter is the rock on which Christ built His Church.
