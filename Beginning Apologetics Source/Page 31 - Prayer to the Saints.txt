<p>Is it biblical to ask the saints in heaven to pray for us? Catholics say yes, since we are all part of the communion of saints. Most Protestants say no, even though many of them recite the Apostles' Creed.  Thus, they profess to believe in the "communion of saints," but usually they do not understand what this means. What does it mean to believe in the communion of saints? Does this belief give us the biblical foundations for the doctrine of intercessory prayer?</p>
<p>COMMUNION OF SAINTS</p>
<p>As the word suggests, the communion of saints refers to the bond of unity among all believers, both living and dead, who are committed followers of Christ. In Christ, we are made part of God's family (1 Tim 3:15), children of God (1 John 3:1), joint heirs with Christ (Rom 8:17), and partakers of the divine nature (2 Pet 1:4). This family communion of saints is known to Catholics as the Mystical Body of Christ.36 We are joined in a supernatural union as members of Christ's own body, and thus as members of one another. Each of us participates in the divine life of Christ Himself.</p>
<p>Be familiar with the image of the Vine and the Branches (John 15:1-5). Remind non-Catholics that because we as branches are connected to Christ the vine, we are also connected to each other.</p>
<p>It is the life and grace of Jesus that gives us life and unites us in our common pilgrimage to heaven.</p>
<p>St. Paul emphasizes this unity in Christ's body in 1 Cor 12:12-27 (especially verses 25-27) and in Rom 12:4-16. Know these passages.</p>
<p>INTERCESSORY PRAYER</p>
<p>What we have said about the communion of saints gives us the biblical reasons why Catholics ask the saints to intercede for them:</p>
<p>(1) All Christians are members of Christ's body and one another (Rom 12:5
- and many others).</p>
<p>(2) Jesus has only one body (Eph 4:4; Col 3:15).</p>
<p>(3) Death cannot separate Christians from Christ or from one another (Rom 8:35-39).</p>
<p>(4) Christians are bound in mutual love (Rom 12:10; 1 Thess 5:11; Gal 6:2).</p>

<well>I am the vine, you are the branches. He who abides in me, and  in him, he it is that bears much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing. John 15:5</well>

36 The teaching that the Church is the Body of Christ is found throughout the NT: 1 Cor 10:16; Gal 3:28; Eph 1:22-23,4:4,4:15-16,5:21-32; Col 1:18,3:15.
