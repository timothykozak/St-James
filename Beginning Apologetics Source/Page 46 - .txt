<div class="well">I Cor 7:32-35: I want you to be free from anxieties The unmarried man is anxious about the affairs of the Lord, how to please the Lord, but the married man is anxious about worldly affairs, how to please his wife, and his interests are divided I say this for your own benefit to secure your undivided devotion to the Lord.</div>
<p>Since St. Paul does not absolutely command celibacy for all full-time ministers, the Catholic Church teaches the requirement of celibacy is a discipline, not a doctrine. Thus, the Church allows certain exceptions to this requirement: for example, married Anglican priests who become Catholic can continue to be married even if they become Catholic priests.</p>
<p>Ask Protestants why they have so few, if any, celibate ministers, especially since St. Paul encourages it so strongly for full-time ministers of Christ.</p>
<p>13. Does it make any difference which Christian denomination  I join?</p>
<p>Although it is very clear in Scripture and early Church history that Christ left only one Church, today we have over 33,000 Christian denominations. Does it matter which of these you join? It most certainly does! If Christ founded only one Church, then all the other Christian churches were founded by men. Although they believe much that is true, and have many members who are sincere Christians, we simply cannot choose any of them over the Church started by Christ.</p>
<p>14. How do we determine which is the Church founded by Christ?</p>
<p>The Church founded by Christ must go back in history to the time of Christ; its doctrines must be the same as those of the Apostolic Church; and its leaders must be able to trace their authority back to the Apostles (see page 15). Thus, historical continuity, doctrinal continuity, and continuity of Apostolic authority are the sure guidelines for determining which Church Jesus founded. Only the Catholic Church meets these requirements.</p>
<p>HISTORICAL CONTINUITY. Any objective history book will show that only the Catholic Church has existed since the time of Christ.4' No Protestant denomination found today existed before 1517.</p>
<p>DOCTRINAL CONTINUITY. The early Church Fathers are our indispensable link to Apostolic Christianity. Their writings tell us what the first Christians believed. A careful study of the early Church Fathers shows they all taught distinctively Catholic doctrines.</p>
<p>CONTINUITY OF APOSTOLIC AUTHORITY.  The Bible and Sacred Tradition are very clear that Christ left a Church that would be governed by a hierarchy of bishops, presbyters, and deacons with the successor of St. Peter as the head. Only the Catholic Church has such a governing hierarchy that can trace its authority - in an unbroken succession - back to the Apostolic authority established by Christ Himself.</p>


41 The word "Catholic" first appears in a letter of St. Ignatius of Antioch (AD 110) to distinguish Christ's Church from heretical groups (Jurgens, #65). Interestingly, the word "Christian" also originated in Antioch (Acts 11:26). St. Ignatius' letter indicates that, by AD 110, the original Christian Church was already well known as the "Catholic Church."
