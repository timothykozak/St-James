<p>united to the Church of Rome in order to maintain the Apostolic Tradition. He then lists all the bishops of Rome up to his time.24 St. Irenaeus presents this teaching as something taken for granted by orthodox Christians.</p>
<p>For 250 years, the Roman Emperors tried to destroy Christianity through persecution. In the first 200 years of Christianity, every Pope but one was martyred�the Romans certainly knew who the head of the Church was!</p>
<p>A Roman Emperor's greatest fear was a rival to the throne. Nevertheless, the emperor Decius (AD 249-251), one of the harshest persecutors of the early Christian Church, made the following remark: "I would far rather receive news of a rival to the throne than of another bishop of Rome."25 Decius said this after he had executed Pope Fabian in 250.</p>
<p>REASON</p>
<p>Finally, appeal to reason. Ask this question. Suppose that the owner of a company had called all the employees together and announced that he was going to be gone for a while. During his absence, he was going to give the keys of the company to his vice-president, Frank, and that whatever Frank commanded would be backed by him. Would you have any doubt that Frank was going to be in charge of the company while the boss was away? Of course not! Then why can't Protestants accept that this is exactly what is described in Mt 16:13-19?</p>




24 St. Irenaeus was bishop of Lyons from about AD 180-200. He is considered one of the greatest theologians of the immediate post-Apostolic period. In his work Against Heresies, St. Irenaeus makes the following statement about the Church of Rome and the successors of St. Peter: "But since it would be too long to enumerate in such a small volume as this the successions of all the Churches, we shall confound all those who, in whatever manner, whether through self-satisfaction or vainglory, or through blindness and wicked opinion, assemble other than where it is proper, by pointing out here the successions of the bishops of the greatest and most ancient Church known to all, founded and organized at Rome by the two most glorious Apostles, Peter and Paul, that Church which has the tradition and the faith which comes down to us after having been announced to men by the Apostles. For with this Church, because of its superior origin, all the Churches must agree, that is, all the faithful in the whole world; and it is in her
that the faithful everywhere have maintained the
Apostolic tradition" (3, 3, 2; Jurgens, #210). St. Irenaeus then goes on to name all the Popes succeeding Peter up to his time� twelve in all (3, 3, 3; Jurgens, #211). The complete list of Popes from St. Peter to Pope Francis-266 in all�can be found in any public library. See list on following pages, from "The List of Popes," Catholic Encyclopedia (New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911).
