<li>Historical perspective. Have non-Catholics stand back and look at Church history. Get them to see that many Protestant beliefs were unheard of for 1500 years after Christ established His Church. Never end a discussion without stressing the fact that all the early Church Fathers were Catholic in their beliefs. Know a few of the early Church Fathers well: especially St. Ignatius of Antioch, St. Justin Martyr, and St. Irenaeus. (See page 8.)</li>
<li>Knowledge. Explain Catholic beliefs clearly. This is your primary task. Keep a good catechism handy for this purpose.
Don't try to defend a doctrine that you don't understand. If you don't know the answer to a question, honestly admit it and tell them you will get back to them later on the subject after you have done some study.</li>
<li>Tempers. Begin and end the discussion with prayer. Keep control of your temper. Apologize if you lose it. Calmly end the discussion if the other person becomes abusive in his approach. Insist that they refrain from abusive attacks on Our Lady and the Eucharist. Ask them simply to state where they disagree and why.</li>
<li>Expertise. Don't be afraid if you are not an expert in Catholic doctrine. You don't have to be; just give them what you know. If you can make just one good point, or correct just one misunderstanding, you have already accomplished a lot. Besides, the very fact that a non-Catholic met a Catholic who is polite, knowledgeable about the Bible, and concerned about saving souls will itself leave a good impression of the Catholic Church.</li>
<li>Caution. Be careful whom you let into your home! Being an apologist doesn't mean throwing away common sense when it comes to trusting strangers.  Learn to explain your faith clearly, defend it charitably, and share it confidently.</li>
