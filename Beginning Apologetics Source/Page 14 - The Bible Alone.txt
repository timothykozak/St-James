<p>Almost all Protestants follow the doctrine of sola scriptura. This doctrine claims that the Bible alone is the authority in matters of faith. Many evangelizers will begin by saying: "Let's agree that the Bible is the sole rule of faith." A Catholic must answer with a firm, "NO." They are really asking you to reject Sacred Tradition and the authority of the Church.</p>
<p>We must show them that Christ left a Church to teach, govern, and sanctify in His name until the end of time. To reject that authority is to reject Christ and His Gospel. We Catholics accept the Bible as an authority in matters of faith because it is God's inspired Word. However, we cannot accept it as the only rule of faith for the following reasons.</p>
<p>It goes against the BIBLE. Scripture tells us that Christ left a Church with divine authority to govern in His name (Mt 16:1320, 18:18; Lk 10:16). Christ promised that this Church would last until the end of time (Mt 16:18, 28:19-20; Jn 14:16). The Bible also tells us that Sacred Tradition is to be followed alongside Sacred Scripture (2 Thess 2:15, 3:6).</p>
<p>The doctrine ofsola scritura is notfound in Scripture. In fact, the Bible tells us that we need more than just the Bible alone. The Bible confirms that not everything Jesus said and did is recorded in Scripture (John 21:25) and that we must also hold fast to oral tradition, the preached Word of God (1 Cor 11:2; 1 Pet 1:25). In 2 Pet 3:15-16, we are warned that Sacred Scripture can be very difficult to interpret, which strongly implies the need for an authoritative interpreter. Finally, 1 Tim 3:15 reassures us that the Church is "the pillar and bulwark of the truth."</p>
<p>It goes against HISTORY. The history of the Bible attests that it was the Church exercising its Apostolic authority that determined what is and is not Scripture. We need the authority of the Church to tell us what belongs in the Bible (1 Tim 3:15).</p>
<p>It goes against COMMONSENSE. Any written document meant to play a crucial role in determining how people live must have a living, continuing authority to guard, guarantee, and officially interpret it. Otherwise, chaos reigns as everyone interprets the document according to his own personal whim.</p>
<p>For example, the Founding Fathers of this country put together a magnificent document to be authoritative in determining how this country would be governed: the U.S. Constitution. They also established a living, continuing authority to guard, guarantee, and officially interpret the Constitution: the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>The Founding Fathers knew that without a living authority the Constitution would lead to endless divisions as every one acted as his own interpreter. God certainly has more wisdom than the founders of this country. He would never have left a written document to be the only rule of faith without a living authority to guard and officially interpret it.</p>
<p>The splintering of Christianity into over 33,000 denominations is the direct fruit of the Bible-alone doctrine. This idea does not come from God and was unheard of for 1500 years before the Reformation.</p>
