<p>9. Can you lose your salvation once you accept Jesus as Lord and Savior?</p>
<p>Most, though not all, Fundamentalists believe that once you accept Jesus as your Lord and Savior, it is impossible to lose your salvation. This doctrine is known as "once saved, always saved." Like many other Protestant doctrines, this teaching was unheard of before the Reformation.</p>
<p>Mt 24:13 tells us that we must "endure to the end" in order to be saved. St. Paul says the same thing in 2 Tim 2:12: that we must hold out to the end if we want to reign with Christ. In Rom 11:22, Christians are warned that they will be cut off if they don't persevere in the kindness of God. Hebrews 6:4-6 describes people who are sharers in the Holy Spirit (born-again Christians) but then fall away from God.</p>
<p>Remember St. Paul's advice: "work out your own salvation with fear and trembling" (Phil 2:12). Who should have more assurance of salvation than St. Paul? Yet he says: "I pommel my body and subdue it, lest after preaching to others I myself should be disqualified" (1 Cor 9:27). Scripture is very clear: Christians can reject God's grace and lose their salvation.</p>
<p>The Catholic Church teaches we must die in sanctifying grace in order to be saved. Any mortal sin leads to a loss of sanctifying grace and the risk of eternal, damnation if we should die in this state.</p>
<p>10. Why does the Catholic Church base some of its doctrines on tradition instead of basing them all on the Bible? Isn't tradition condemned in the Bible (Mt 15:3;Mk 7:9; Col 2:8)?</p>
<p>Fundamentalists think all tradition is condemned in Scripture. But the Bible speaks of two kinds of tradition: human and apostolic. Bad human tradition is condemned. In Mt 15:3 and Mk 7:9, Jesus clearly condemns human tradition that sets aside the commandments of God. In Col 2:8, St. Paul tells us to beware of false reasoning "according to human tradition." But in condemning erroneous human traditions (small "t"), neither Jesus nor St. Paul is condemning Apostolic Traditions (capital "T"), the deposit of divine truths that Jesus orally entrusted to the Apostles.</p>
<p>The Bible actually commands following Apostolic Traditions. St. Paul commends the Corinthians for following Apostolic Traditions (1 Cor 11:2). St. Paul commands the Thessalonians to keep them: "So then, brethren, stand firm and hold to the traditions which you were taught by us, either by word of mouth or by letter." (2 Thess 2:15; see also 2 Thess 3:6). Obeying St. Paul, the Church bases its doctrines on Sacred Scripture and Apostolic Tradition.</p>
