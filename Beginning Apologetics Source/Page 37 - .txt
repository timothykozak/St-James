<p>What do we believe about Purgatory?</p>
<p>Purgatory is a temporary state of purfication for the imperfect saints. The souls of the just who have died in the state of grace but with venial sins or with reparation due for forgiven mortal and venial sins are fully cleansed in Purgatory so that they may enter heaven. In Purgatory all remaining reparation for sin is made; all remaining self-love is purged and purified until only love of God remains.</p>
<p>Is Purgatory Scriptural?</p>
<p>First, we should note that the word "purgatory" is not found in Sacred Scripture. This is not the point. The words "Trinity" and "Incarnation" are not found in Scripture, yet these doctrines are clearly taught there. Likewise, the Bible teaches that an intermediate state of purfication exists. We call it Purgatory. What is important is the doctrine, not the name.</p>
<p>Where does the Bible refer to the doctrine of Purgatory?</p>
<div class="well">Mt 12:32: And whoever says a word against the Son of man will be forgiven; but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come.</div>
<p>Jesus implies that some sins can be forgiven in the next world. Sin cannot be forgiven in hell. There is no sin to be forgiven in heaven. Any remission of sin in the next world can only occur in Purgatory.</p>
<div class="well">1 Cor3:15: If any man's work is burned up, he will suffer loss, though he himself will be saved, but only as through fire.</div>
<p>This cannot refer to eternal loss in hell, for there no one is saved. Nor can it refer to heaven, for there no one suffers. It refers, then, to a middle state where the soul temporarily suffers loss so that it may gain heaven. This is essentially the definition of Purgatory.</p>
<div class="well">1 Pet 3:18-20: For Christ also died for sins once for all, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh but made alive in the spirit; in which he went and preached to the spirits in prison, who formerly did not obey, when God's patience waited in the days of Noah, during the building of the ark, in which a few, that is eight persons, were saved through water.</div>
<div class="well">1 Peter 4:6: For this is why the gospel was preached even to the dead, that though judged in the flesh like men, they might live in the spirit like God.</div>
<p>Note that it is a prison for disobedient spirits, and yet they were saved when Jesus preached to them. This is not hell, because no one is saved from hell. This is probably not the "limbo of the fathers," (often called "Abraham's bosom," where the righteous souls of the OT waited until Christ opened the gates of heaven), because this is a place for disobedient spirits. One cannot imagine that St. Peter is describing the waiting place of such righteous OT saints as David and John the Baptist when he mentions disobedient spirits.</p>
