<p>1. Why do Catholics adore Mary, who is just a human being?</p>
<p>Catholics do not adore Mary; we venerate and honor her. Why? The angel calls her "full of grace," and one who has "found favor with God" (Lk 1:28, 30). Elizabeth, filled with the Holy Spirit calls her "blessed are you among women" (verse 42), Mary herself declares that "all generations will call me blessed" (verse 48). Catholics, following Scripture, always call her blessed. Do you?</p>
<p>2. Why do Catholics call Mary the "Mother of God"? Wouldn't this mean Mary existed before God, or that she is older than God?</p>
<p>We call Mary Mother of God because she gave birth to Jesus, who is God. We follow the Spirit-filled Elizabeth who declared in Luke 1:43: "And why is this granted to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?" Jesus is true God and true man: two natures in one undivided Person. By being the Mother of Jesus, Mary is also the Mother of God, the Second Person of the Holy Trinity.</p>
<p>Mary did not give birth merely to a human nature, but to a person, the Son of God who took from her flesh a pure human nature. Lk 1:35: "the child to be born will be called holy, the Son of God." Gal 4:4: "God sent forth His Son, born of woman." If Jesus is truly God-made-man, then Mary is truly the Mother of God. Obviously, Mary did not exist before God. Jesus is the Son of
God from all eternity, who became also the Son of Mary in time.</p>
<p>3. Why do Catholics believe Mary was immaculately conceived? Romans 3:23 says that "ALL HAVE SINNED and are deprived of the glory of God "</p>
<p>Luke writes that Mary is full of grace, highly favored. Lk 1:37: "For with God nothing will be impossible." She is the "woman" of Gen 3:15 whose enmity with Satan and sin is absolute. She is the Ark of the Covenant (Ex 25:11-21) made to hold the living Word of God: a holy tabernacle made not of the purest gold, but of the purest flesh. St. Paul is emphasizing the universal aspect of sin extending to Jews and Gentiles alike. Babies have not sinned; Adam and Eve before the fall had not sinned; Jesus never sinned. These are some exceptions that fall outside St. Paul's condemnation. Mary is another.</p>
<p>4. If Mary never sinned, she doesn't need a Savior. So why does Mary say in Luke 1:4 7: "my spirit rejoices in God MY SAVIOR."</p>
<p>Mary was saved by the merits of Christ, just as we are. The difference between Mary and other Christians is that her salvation from sin was more perfect. While we are freed from original sin at our baptism, Mary was preserved from original sin at her conception. But Jesus is the Savior in both cases.<p>
<p>5. Why do Catholics believe that Mary was a Perpetual Virgin? Matt. 13:55-56 says that Jesus had brothers and sisters. Catholics are not alone in this belief. Protestant Reformers Martin Luther, John Calvin, and Ulrich Zwingli also defended</p>
