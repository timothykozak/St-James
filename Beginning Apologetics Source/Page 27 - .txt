<p>11. Why do Catholics call Mary "Blessed" and honor her with prayers and devotions, like the Rosary?</p>
<p>Scripture calls her "blessed" and promises that all generations will invoke her by that title (see question 1). We honor Mary because of her great privileges: she was conceived without sin, became the mother of God while remaining a virgin, and was assumed bodily into heaven. There she reigns as queen of heaven and earth, mother of the Church, God's greatest creature, and mankind's greatest boast. We honor her because Jesus honored her�perfectly obeying the fourth commandment�and we are called to imitate Jesus.</p>
<p>12. Is the "Hail Mary" scriptural?</p>
<p>Yes, the first part of the prayer is taken almost word-for-word from Scripture.</p>
<p>"Hail, full of grace, the lord is with you!" (Luke 1:28).</p>
<p>"Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb" (Luke 1:42) - Jesus.</p>
<p>The second part is based on Scripture.</p>
<p>Holy Mary - "you have found favor with God" (Luke 1:30)</p>
<p>Mother of God - "mother of my Lord" (Luke 1:43)</p>
<p>Pray for us sinners - (as we Christians pray for one another)</p>
<p>Now and at the hour of our death. Amen.</p>
<p>13. Isn't the Rosary a kind of repetitious prayer condemned by Jesus in Mt 6:7?</p>
<p>In Mt 6:7, Jesus is not condemning all repeated prayers. He says, "do not babble like the pagans, who think that they will be heard because of their many words" (NAB). Jesus is teaching Christians that we are not to pray with the pagan attitude that the more we repeat a prayer the more likely we are to be heard (see 1 Kings 18:25-29 for an example of this pagan mentality).</p>
<p>A Christian who thinks he needs to repeat a prayer in order to be heard in heaven has a problem with faith. This is the error Jesus is correcting. Notice that Jesus repeats the same prayer three times in the Garden of Gethsemani (Mt 26:44). The publican who humbly repeated, "God, be merciful to me a sinner" (Lk 18:13) went home justified. The four living creatures in heaven repeat day and night, "Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord God Almighty, who was and is and is to come" (Rev 4:8). These verses show that prayer repeated with the proper attitude is very pleasing to God. The Rosary, recited devoutly, fulfills part of the biblical exhortation to "pray without ceasing" (1 Thess 5:17).</p>
<p>14. Aren't Catholics superstitious for believing that medals of Mary and relics of saints can perform miracles?</p>
<p>The Catholic Church teaches that only God can perform a true miracle. But we also know that God can act either directly or through secondary agents, like people. God sometimes even performs miracles through inanimate objects in order to show the intercessory power of a particular saint. A man came back to life when he contacted the bones of the holy prophet Elisha (2 Kings 13:20-21). God performed miraculous cures through Peter's shadow (Acts 5:15-16) and through handkerchiefs that had touched St. Paul (Acts 19:11-12), showing the great intercessory power of St. Peter and St. Paul. Medals of Our Lady and relics of saints have no power to cause miracles in themselves. Rather, God performs miracles through these medals and relics to show the great intercessory power of Mary and the saints.</p>
