<p>We are members of Christ's one body, united in His divine life even beyond the grave, and concerned with each other's salvation and growth in God's family. In that union, we call for help and support from our older brothers and sisters who have already won their crown of glory.
Just as in our human families we naturally turn to our siblings for aid and example, how much more should we turn to our supernatural family for help and inspiration.
Several objections are directed against the Catholic position on intercessory prayer.</p>
<p>Objection 1:</p>
<p>The saints are dead. Catholics practice necromancy, communication with the dead, which is condemned (Dt 18:10-11).</p>
<p>Necromancy means summoning forth spirits from the shadowy underworld (OT "Sheol"), in order to converse with them. By asking the saints in heaven to intercede for us, Catholics are not conjuring roaming spirits or communicating in any "spiritualistic" way. So prayer to the saints has nothing to do with necromancy.</p>
<p>Nor are the saints dead. The saints in heaven are alive and with God: "He is not God of the dead, but of the living" (Mk 12:26-27). In Mark 9:4, Jesus is seen conversing with Elijah and Moses. Jesus tells the Good Thief: "Truly, I say to you, today you will be with me in Paradise" (Lk 23:43). In fact, the saints in heaven are more alive than we are. They are free all sin. They enjoy the fullness of God's giving presence. Flooded with God's they care more about us now than the: on earth.</p>
<p>Just as Paul asked fellow belie (saints) to pray for him (Rom 15:30; Col 1 Thess 5:25; Eph 6:18-19; 2 Thess) now we can ask Paul and the other saints in heaven to pray for us. We are not cut off from each other at death, rather we are brought closer through the communion we share in Christ.</p>
<p>We know that angels and saints r the prayers of the holy ones at God's (Tob 12:12; Rev 5:8; Rev 8:3-4), supporting those prayers with their intercessions. martyrs underneath the heavenly altar cr: out for earthly vindication (Rev 6:9-showing they are aware of, and concerned with, earthly affairs. The angels and saints in heaven will intercede for us before thn throne of God if they are petitioned in prayer.</p>
