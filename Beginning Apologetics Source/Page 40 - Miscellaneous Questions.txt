<p>1. Why do Catholics call their priests "father," when Jesus commands us in Matthew 23:9 to "call no man your father on earth?"</p>
<p>In Matthew 23:1-12, when Jesus tells us to call no man "father" or "teacher," He is using figurative language to emphasize that all legitimate authority and truth ultimately come from God. We cannot take these passages literally. Otherwise, Jesus would be contradicting Himself for repeating the 4th command, "honor your father and mother" (Mt 19:19), and referring to "Father Abraham" (Luke 16:24).</p>
<p>Throughout the Bible men are called fathers and teachers. Both Catholics and Protestants call earthly men fathers and teachers. St. Stephen and St. Paul call the Jewish religious leaders "fathers" (Acts 7:2 and 22:1). St. Paul calls the Corinthians "my beloved children.... For I became your father in Christ Jesus through the Gospel" (1 Cor 4:14-15; also see 1 Thess 2:11, 1 Tim 1:2, and Tit 1:4). St. Paul became their spiritual father because he cooperated with God in giving them spiritual life, just as biological fathers cooperate with God in giving physical life. Catholics call their priests "father" because, like St. Paul, priests cooperate with God in giving spiritual life to their flock by preaching the Gospel and administering the sacraments.</p>
<p>2. Why do Catholics worship statues in violation of Exodus 20:4-5?</p>
<p>Catholics certainly don't worship statues, or anything created. The Catholic Church teaches that only God is to be worship to worship anything created is to commit the serious sin of idolatry. In Ex 20:4-5, God prohibits the making of images for the purpose of worshiping them. But God not prohibit image-making altogether.  In Ex 25:18-19, God commands Moses to make statues of angels (cherubim). In Num 21:8, God tells Moses to make a bronze serpent (seraph), which the Israelites had to look upon in order to be healed. The Jews also used many carved images in the Temple, including cherubim, oxen, lions, palm trees, and flowers (1 Kings 6 and 7).</p>
<p>Catholics use statues and other images to call to mind the holy people they represent: Jesus, the angels, and the saints. For the same reason, Protestants use Christmas nativity scenes to depict the same holy people: Jesus, the angels, and the saints. Catholics simply use statues and images in devotions all year around.</p>
<p>The rejection of statues and other ages in Church devotional life is a heresy known as "iconoclasm." It was first seen in Christianity in the eighth century when the wicked Emperor Leo the Isaurian, influenced by the new religion of Islam (founded in AD 622), began attacking the use of statues and icons in the Church. In the Second Council of Nicea in AD 787, the Church condemned this heresy. It did not resurface in Christianity until the Reformation.</p>
