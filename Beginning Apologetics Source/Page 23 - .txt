divine and one human), He is one Divine Person. Since this one person was born of Mary, she truly is the Mother of the one Divine Person.: in short, the Mother of God.
If a person denies that Mary is the Mother of God, whether he realizes it or not, he is denying the Incarnation. He is saying either that Jesus is not God, or that Jesus is two persons�one human and one divine. Protestants ask: "How can Mary, a creature, be the mother of God the Creator?" We answer that when the eternal Son of God became man, He assumed a human nature, which made it possible for Him to be born of a woman just as we were.
BIBLICAL BASIS
� Luke 1:43: Elizabeth calls her "mother of my Lord." In the NT, "Lord" refers only to God.
� Mt 1:23: "Behold, a virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and His name shall be called Emmanuel' (which means, God is with us)."
� Luke 1:35: "the child to be born will be called holy, the Son of God."
� Gal 4:4: "But when the time had fully come, God sent forth His Son, born of woman."
EARLY CHURCH FATHERS
"For our God, Jesus Christ, was conceived by Mary in accord with God's plan.. "26 (St. Ignatius, AD 110).
"The Virgin Mary, ... being obedient to His word, received from an angel the glad tidings that she would bear God"27 (St. Irenaeus, AD 180-199).

Remind Protestants that if they look at Church history they will find that Mary's title of Mother of God was not rejected until AD 429. In that year, a bishop named Nestorius promoted the heresy that Jesus was two distinct persons , and that Mary was only the mother of the human person. In AD 431, the Council of Ephesus condemned this heresy. It did not surface again in Christianity until after the Reformation. Notice how a correct belief about Mary leads to a correct belief about Jesus.
In regard to the other three Marian doctrines, biblical passages in support of them are not explicit28 and we have to rely on Apostolic Tradition and the teaching authority of the Church.
Assumption. The doctrine doesn't tell us if Mary died; it merely states that after the completion of her life, she
was taken body and soul into heaven. Note that Elijah and Enoch were assumed into heaven, just as the righteous will be at the end of time (see Gn 5:24; 2 Kg 2:11; 1 Thess 4:17; Heb 11:5). Why is it hard to believe that God gave His mother this privilege? No city ever claimed her body. There is no record of her relics or remains anywhere.
Immaculate Conception. The doctrine doesn't say that Mary didn't need a savior. Like all the OT saints, Mary was saved through the anticipated merits of Jesus. Mary's salvation was simply more
