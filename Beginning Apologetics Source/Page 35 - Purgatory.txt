<p>In order to defend the doctrine of Purgatory, we must explain two preliminary distinctions:</p>
<ul>
    <li>between guilt and punishment; and</li>
    <li>between mortal and venial sin.</li>
</ul>
<p>Does God forgive the guilt of sin and still require punishment (reparation, atonement, expiation)?</p>
<p>Ask King David. In 2 Sam 12:13-14 we read:</p>

<p>James 1:14-15 reads:</p>
<div class="well">each person is tempted when he is lured and enticed by his own desire. Then desire when it has conceived gives birth to sin; and sin when it is full grown brings forth death.</div>
<p>St. James distinguishes desire from sin, and beginning sin from mature sin which brings death. Sin which brings death to the soul is mortal. Sin which only wounds and disfigures the soul is venial.</p>
<p>What if you die with only venial sins?</p>
<p>The souls of those who die in the prefect stat of grace, without the least sin or reparation due to sin, go directly to heaven.  The souls of those who die in the</p>
