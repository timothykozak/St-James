perfect. By God's grace, she was preserved from sin at her conception. In contrast, we are cleansed from sin after our birth.</p>
Perpetual Virginity. Mary's per-
_____ petual virginity was not challenged
in the early Church until the time of
St. Jerome (around AD 400). This
doctrine was not rejected by the
founders of Protestantism. Note that
"brothers" in the Bible can also mean
"relatives." If Jesus had blood brothers, He
would not have entrusted Mary to John, but
to one of them. Two so-called "brothers" of
Jesus (Mt 13:55)�James and Joseph�are
identified as sons of another Mary, the wife
of Clopas (compare Mt 27:56 and Jn 19:25).
APPENDIX 2: THE PROTESTANT REFORMERS' VIEW OF MARY
Luther, Calvin, and Zwingli, the three fathers of the Reformation, each affirmed the Catholic doctrines that Mary is the Mother of God and a Perpetual Virgin.
MARY AS MOTHER OF GOD
Martin Luther: "Mary became the Mother of God, in which work so many and such great good things are bestowed on her as pass man's understanding. Hence men have
crowded all her glory into a single word, calling
her the Mother of God. No one can say anything
greater of her or to her, though he had as many
tongues as there are leaves on the trees.""
John Calvin: "It cannot be denied that
God in choosing and destining Mary
to be the Mother of His Son, granted
her the highest honor. ... Elizabeth
calls Mary Mother of the Lord,
because the unity of the person in the
two natures of Christ was such that she could
have said that the mortal man engendered in the

womb of Mary was at the same time the eternal God."30
Ulrich Zwingli: "It was given to
her what belongs to no creature,
-	that in the flesh she should bring
-	forth the Son of God."31
MARY AS PERPETUAL VIRGIN
Luther: "Christ, our Savior, was the real and natural fruit of Mary's virginal womb.... This was without the co-operation of a man, and she remained a virgin after that. 1112
Calvin: "There have been certain folk who have wished to suggest from this passage [Matt 1:25] that the Virgin Mary had other children than the Son of God; and that Joseph had then dwelt with her later; but what folly this is! For the gospel writer did not wish to record what happened afterwards; he simply wished to make clear Joseph's obedience and to show also that Joseph had been well and truly assured that it was God who had sent His angel to Mary. He had therefore never dwelt with her nor had he shared her company.... And besides this Our Lord Jesus Christ is called the first-born. This is not because there was a second or a third, but because the gospel writer is paying regard to the precedence. Scripture speaks thus of naming the first-born whether or no there was any question of the second."33
Zwingli: "I believe with all my heart according to the word of holy gospel that this pure virgin bore for us the Son of God and that she remained, in the birth and after it, a pure and unsullied virgin, for eternity."34
