<p>elder. But this is just like the President of the United States saying, "My fellow Americans." This would certainly not indicate that the President has no more authority than an ordinary citizen.</p>
<p>As an Apostle, St. Peter certainly considers his authority to be greater than that of an ordinary elder. After all, St. Peter goes on to admonish these "fellow elders" (1 Pet 5:2-4) as one having authority over them. In calling them fellow elders, St. Peter is simply acknowledging the obvious: they too are Church leaders. For Protestants to insist that Peter, as an Apostle, had no greater authority than an ordinary elder, shows how little they appreciate what Scripture says about the great office of Apostle.</p>
<p>Many Protestants quote Gal 2:11-14 as well, attempting to show that Peter was not infallible 22 and that Paul did not consider him the head of the Church. This position is not supportable. If they think Peter was not infallible, why do they accept his two letters as inspired and, therefore, infallible? We must accept that all the Apostles were infallible. After the Apostles, the popes individually and the bishops as a group in union with the pope, are infallible.</p>
<p>St. Paul correcting St. Peter for weak behavior is no different from St. Catherine of Siena correcting weak popes in the Middle Ages. There was no doctrine involved. St. Peter himself had settled the doctrinal point at the Council of Jerusalem. St. Paul corrected St. Peter for being unwilling to confront the Judaizers from Jerusalem. Remember, St. Paul was among those who fell silent at the Council of Jerusalem once St. Peter spoke.</p>
<p>HISTORY</p>
<p>The early Church always accepted the Bishop of Rome as head of the Church. Around A1 80, the Church at Corinth deposed its lawful leaders. The fourth bishop of Rome, Pope Clement I, was called to settle the matter even though St. John the Apostle was still alive and 'much closer to Corinth than was Rome.</p>
<p>St. Irenaeus, who was taught by St. Polycarp (a disciple of St. John the Apostle), stresses that Christians must be</p>



22 "Infallible" means incapable of teaching error in matters of faith and morals. It does not mean impeccable: incapable of committing sin.
23 St. Clement died about AD 80, some 20 years before the last Apostle, St. John, died. Although St. John was still alive in Ephesus (less than 300 miles from Corinth), the Corinthians appealed to the Bishop of Rome (more than 700 miles away) because he had the "keys" of authority. Note how forcefully Pope Clement writes to the Church at Corinth: "You, therefore, who laid the foundation of the rebellion, submit to the presbyters and be chastened to repentance, bending your knees in a
spirit of humility" (First Letter to the Corinthians, 57,
1; Jurgens,#27).
And again, "If anyone disobey the things which have been said by Him through us, let them know that they will involve themselves in transgression and in no small danger" (First Letter to the Corinthians, 59, 1; Jurgens, #28a).
