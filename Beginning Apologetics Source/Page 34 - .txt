<p>Objection 3:</p>
<p>The saints in heaven can't hear us.</p>
<p>Why not? Aren't they more alive now than when they were with us? The medium of communication is Christ himself - the vine between the branches. We and the saints form one communion, one body of Christ, being members of Him and members of one another. Heb 12:1 tells us that we are surrounded by "a cloud of witnesses." How could those watching be unconcerned about our welfare? Look at Rev 5:8 and Rev 8:3. The petitions offered as incense to God must be for those who still need help, the holy ones on earth. They are offered by those who can help the most, the holy ones in heaven.</p>
<p>In the parable of Lazarus and the rich man (Lk 16:19-30), the departed rich man is able to pray to Abraham and intercede for his brothers. This implies that there can be communication across the abyss, and that fraternal charity extends beyond the grave.</p>
<p>We are certain that the saints in heaven enjoy the face to face vision of God (1 Cor 13:12; 1 Jn 3:2). It is in this vision that they are aware of our prayers to them.</p>
<p>Objection 4:</p>
<p>How can saints hear all these prayers, from all different people, all the time?  It must sound like a deafening babble.</p>
<p>Heaven has no space or time. Ever appears to God as one eternal present like God, the saints are outside of the limitations of space and time. Our earthly knowing is limited and incomplete "For now we see in a mirror dimly, but the to face. Now I know in part; then I shall understand fully, even as I have been fully understood" (1 Cor 13:12). Our heavenly way of knowing is full and perfect.</p>
<p>In heaven, our human nature will be radically elevated beyond anything we can imagine:</p>
<well>1 Cor2:9: no eye has seen, nor ear heard, nor the heart of mna conceived, what God has prepared for those who love him.</well>
<p>St. Peter says we will "become partakers of the divine nature" (2 Peter 1:4). We will share in God's very nature, which makes all things possible (Luke 1:37), including hearing thousands of prayer requests simultaneously.</p>
<p>Think about it. If finite engineers can make inanimate computer chips capable of processing millions of instructions simultaneously, it should be child's play for the infinite God to make His living saints capable of processing millions of requests simultaneously.</p>
