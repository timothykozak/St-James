<p>Jesus changes Simon's name to Peter, which mean "rock."" Our Lord says this rock will be God's way of preserving the Church from corruption until the end of time. Our Lord knew St. Peter would be dead by AD 70. Therefore Christ must have intended the office of Peter to last until the end of time. St. Peter is given the "keys to the kingdom of heaven."9 This is an awesome gift. To nobody else does Christ give this ruling power. Ask non-Catholics to reflect on this unique privilege instead of trying, by verbal acrobatics, to explain away the title "Peter."</p>
<p>Ask them: Why would Jesus give this tremendous authority to St. Peter and not intend for it to be passed on? If the early Christians needed an authoritative leader, later Christians would need tone even more. Remember, many of the early Chris- tians heard the Gospel from Christ Himself and knew the Apostles personally. After all the Apostles died, the Church would have even greater need of the power of the keys when enemies would try to corrupt the teachings of Christ.</p>
<p>Although the Apostles as a group were all given the power "to bind and to loose" in Mt 18:18, St. Peter received this power individually when he was given the "keys." Point out that Jesus would not have guaranteed to back up the doctrinal teachings of St. Peter and his successors unless He was also going to protect each from teaching false doctrine in his official capacity as Shepherd of the Church.</p>
<p>Know Lk 22:31-32 and John 21:15-17 as well. In the passage from St. Luke, Jesus prays that Peter's faith would not fail; Peter in turn would strengthen the other disciples. In the passage from St. John, Jesus clearly makes Peter the shepherd of His Church. So St. Peter is the rock on which Christ builds His Church. He is given the "keys of the Kingdom;" and he is made shepherd of Christ's flock: solid biblical evidence that Jesus made St. Peter the first Pope. The popes are Christ's vicars, the visible and earthly heads of Christ's Church while Christ is the invisible and supreme head.</p>
<p>Be familiar with Acts 15. This gives an account of the first Church council, the Council of Jerusalem. Called at the request of St. Paul, this council met to decide whether Gentiles had to follow the Law of Moses as well as the Law of Christ. Notice that there was much discussion among the</p>


19 Jesus is drawing this image of "the keys" from Is 22:19-22. From this context, at least three concepts are included. (1) The keys are a symbol of the authority given to the chief official�the Prime Minister�of the Kingdom of David. (2) The Prime Minister is a father-figure. Remember, "Pope" comes from the Italian word for "Papa"�father. (3) The office implies dynastic succession. The office of Prime Minister continued as long as the Kingdom of David continued. Catholics believe that Christ is the King, and that the Pope is the "Prime Minister" of His heavenly kingdom, the Church. Christ is the Head of the Church; the Pope is His earthly representative.
