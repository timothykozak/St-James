<p>"Apologetics" simply means giving a reasoned explanation for your faith. A Catholic apologist charitably explains and defends Catholic doctrine using Scripture, history, and common sense.
Apologetics fulfills the command of St. Peter:
1 Pet 3:15-16: Always be prepared to make a defense to any one who calls you to account for the hope that is in you, yet do it with gentleness and reverence.
A beginning apologist must remember the following points:</p>
<ol class="list-group">
    <li class="list-group-item">Holiness. Base all apologetics on the love of God and His Truth. An apologist who is not concerned with personal holiness will not be very effective.</li>
    <li class="list-group-item">Charity. Remember that you are a missionary, not a. debater. Your goal is to explain and evangelize, not to win arguments. You must have charity at all times, even in the most heated discussions.</li>
    <li class="list-group-item">Unity. Begin by stressing that we agree with other Christians on many important points. Acknowledge the sincerity and zeal of our separated brothers in Christ.</li>
    <li class="list-group-item">Study. Be prepared to study at least 30 minutes three times per week. Read the Bible 20 minutes, and use the other 10 minutes to read a good Catholic catechism. In your study of the Bible, concentrate on the New Testament. Be sure to highlight important passages and use the cross-references and footnotes.</li>
    <li class="list-group-item">Equal time. Do not allow the non-Catholic evangelizer to take up all the time or ask all the questions. Divide the time equally and ask him a few challenging questions of your own.</li>
    <li class="list-group-item">Focus. Insist on staying on the main issues during the discussion. Don't let the other person ask a dozen different questions and expect you to answer them all in ten minutes. Explain the need to stay focused and to allow plenty of time for answers. The chief concern is to shed light on the truth, not to make cheap debating points.</li>
    <li class="list-group-item">Topics. Do not feel obligated to stick with the subjects non-Catholics bring upï¿½especially if you're not familiar with them. Insist on talking about the Eucharist at the start of your discussion because it is so important and because it divides Catholics from virtually all Protestants. (See???)</li>
    <li class="list-group-item">Interpretation. Do not accept the Protestant interpretation of a verse when it contradicts Catholic doctrine. Read it yourself in context and show how the verse can be interpreted to support the Catholic position. Protestants often distort Bible verses to fit their denominational teaching.</li>
    <li class="list-group-item">Canon of the Bible. Show how the Bible was put together by the Catholic Church. Stress the fact that Christianity was around for 350 years before the canon of the New Testament was determined.  (See???)</li>
</ol>
