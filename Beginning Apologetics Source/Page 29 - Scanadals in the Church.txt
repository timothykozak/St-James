<p>In the past years, the Catholic Church has been hit with one scandal after another.  Many of these crimes involve priests in acts of pedophilia.  This is a horrific sin, and in priests it is truly an abomination.  As a Catholic, you can be sure that you will be asked questions about this.  How do you respond?</p>
<p>Acknowledge the situation honestly. Don't try to explain it away. Tell people that scandals have badly wounded the Church. Also, admit that many mistakes have been made by our Church leaders in handling this issue. Now they are dealing with this problem in a forthright way. In some cases, the Vatican is directly intervening.</p>
<p>Many Protestants will try to use these scandals to attack celibacy, and to challenge the claim that the Catholic Church is the true Church. You must be prepared to respond to both arguments.</p>
<p>CELIBACY</p>
<p>Celibacy has nothing to do with pedophilia or other sex scandals involving priests. Most pedophiles are married men. We are seeing pedophilia in major institutions everywhere, not just in the Catholic Church. Remind Protestants that in recent years we had one television evangelist after another involved in sex scandals, some involving perverted sex. All of these televangelists were married. Nobody blamed these scandals on the institution of marriage! Nobody demanded that Protestant ministers renounce marriage.</p>
<p>People do not get involved in sex scandals because they are married or celibate. They commit these sins because they fail God as individuals. We don't judge marriage by those who break their marriage vows. Neither should we judge celibacy by those who break their celibacy vows. Marriage and celibacy should both be judged by those who are faithful to their vows.</p>
<p>Remember, about half of all marriages break up. Does this mean that we should get rid of marriage? Of course Mt 19:10-12	not! It means we should work to strengthen married couples in their vocation. Similarly, the Church is not going to get rid of celibacy because a very few priests break their vows.</p>
<p>We know that marriage is a good thing because it was instituted by God, and made a sacrament by Christ. We know that celibacy is good because it was praised by Jesus (Mt 19:10-12), and strongly recommended by St. Paul for those who would devote themselves entirely to the ministry (1 Cor 7:32-35). We all know that millions of Christians have led saintly lives as both celibate and married people.</p>


<div class="well">The disciples said to him, "If such is the case of a man with his wife, it is not expedient to marry." But he said to them, "Not all men can receive this precept, but only those to whom it is given. For there are eunuchs who have been so from birth... and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. He who is able to receive this, let him receive it."</div>


<p>THE TRUE CHURCH</p>
<p>Scandals in the Church are not an argument against the Catholic claim to be the true Church. In the OT, we find baby sacrifice and temple prostitution involving leaders of the OT religion (Jer 32:32-35; 2 Kgs 23:7). Of the twelve Apostles, one betrayed Christ, one denied Him, one refused to believe in His Resurrection, and they all abandoned Him at the Garden of Gethsemani.</p>
<p>The Catholic Church is both human and divine. Because it is human, it will have scandals. Because it is divine, it will last forever. Scandals are found in all denominations; they have nothing to do with the Catholic Church being the true Church.</p>
<p>What St. Paul wrote concerning the Jews applies also to Christians:
    <div class="well">Rom 3:3-4: What if some were unfaithful? Does their faithlessness nullify the faithfulness of God? By no means!</div></p>
<p>Christ's faithfulness to His Church remains even when some of its members are unfaithful:
<div class="well">2 Tim 2:13: If we are faithless, he remains faithful for he cannot deny himself.</div></p>
<p>Scandals do not prove that the Catholic Church is false. They only prove what is obvious: that the Church contains sinners well as saints, tares along with the wheat. the parable of the wheat and the wee (Mt 13:24-30), Our Lord makes clear ti good and evil will exist side by side until t
end of time:</p>
<div class="well">The kingdom of heaven maybe compared to a man who sowed good seed in his field; but while men were sleeping, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat, and went away. So when the plants came up and bore grain, then the weeds appeared also. And the servants of the house-holder came and said to him, "Sir, did you not sow good seed in your field? How then has it weeds?" He said to them, "An enemy has done this." The servants said to him, "Then do you want us to go and gather them?" But he said, "No; lest in gathering the weeds you root up the wheat along with them. Let both grow together until the harvest; and at harvest time I will tell the reapers, Gather the weeds first and bind them in bundles to be burned, but gather the wheat into my barn."</div>
<p>Mt 13:47-48 also confirms that the Churc contains good and bad members alike:
<div class="well">Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net which was thrown into the sea and gathered fish of every kind; when it was full, men the it ashore and sat down and sorted the good into vessels but threw away the bad.</div></p>
<p>35 The parallel construction of Matthew 16:1
identifies the kingdom of heaven as Christ's Chu: "I will build my church.... I will give you the key the kingdom of heaven...." Therefore, all the kingdom parables in Matthew 13 are describing the Church. also: Matthew 21:33-34 and Luke 22:24-30.</p>
