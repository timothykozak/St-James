<p>baptism until he can confirm this decision at the age of reason.</p>
<p>7. Aren't we saved by faith alone as St. Paul says in Romans 3:28?</p>
<p>When St. Paul says, "For we hold that a man is justified by faith apartfrom works of law," he is teaching that the works of the OT Mosaic law, such as circumcision, could not bring salvation. In the NT, faith does bring salvation, provided it is made alive by charity. Saving faith is active: it is "faith working through love" (Gal 5:6).</p>
<p>In 1 Cor 13:2, St. Paul tells us that faith without love (charity) is nothing (it cannot save). Charity means love of God, and Jesus says that if we love Him, we will keep His commandments (Jn 14:21). When the rich man asks Jesus what he must do to be saved, Jesus answers: "keep the commandments" (Mt 19:16-17). Thus it is clear from Scripture that faith alone is not enough for salvation. We must also have charity and keep God's commandments.</p>
<p>St. James condemns the idea that we are saved by faith apart from good works: "See that a man is justified by works and not by faith alone.40... For as the body apart from the spirit is dead, so faith apart from works is dead" (Jam 2:24, 26).</p>
<p>The Catholic Church teaches that we are saved by God's grace alone. Grace enables us to have the saving faith that works in love (Eph 2:8-10). All good works must be done in the grace of God to have any supernatural value.</p>
<p>8. If the redemptive work of Christ is all-sufficient, why do Catholics insist on various good works and penances?</p>
<p>Fundamentalists think that because Catholics teach salvation depends on faith and good works, Catholics must not believe the redemptive work of Christ is sufficient. They see good works, penances, Purgatory, prayer to the saints, and the sacraments, as unnecessary additions to the completed work of Christ. Protestants have this notion because they confuse salvation with redemption.</p>
<p>Catholics firmly agree with Protestants that the redemptive work of Christ is complete and all-sufficient. Through His suffering, death, and resurrection, Jesus redeemed everyone: He paid for all sins and made it possible for anyone to be saved. However, we know that not everyone is automatically saved.</p>
<p>All Christians admit that people can fail to be saved by refusing to repent, or by refusing to cooperate with God's grace in other areas. Although the redemptive work of Christ is complete, the merits of His redemption must still be applied to each person in order for him to be saved. Thus, a person must repent (Mt 4:17), believe in Jesus (Acts 16:3 1), keep the commandments (Mt 19:16-17), and live a life of charity (1 Cor 13:1-3), as Scripture plainly teaches. A Catholic who performs good works in Christ isn't denying the completed work of Christ's redemption; he is depending on it.</p>


40 Luther's battle cry, "justification by faith alone," is expressly contradicted by Scripture, which explains why he belittled the book of James (a part of God's infallible Word) as "an epistle of straw."
