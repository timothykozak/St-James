have eternal life. When Jesus explains that the bread of life is literally His flesh, we must accept His clear words.
Many Protestants claim that in John 6:60-70, Jesus explains that He was only speaking symbolically in the previous verses. They focus on verse 63, "It is the spirit that gives life, the flesh is of no avail; the words that I have spoken to you are spirit and life." Be prepared to deal with this objection as follows:
(a) Jesus' Eucharistic talk ends with verse 58 (see verse 59). The dialogue of verses 60-70 occurs later and deals with faith, not the Eucharist.
(b) The word "spirit" is nowhere used in the Bible to mean "symbolic." The spiritual is just as real as the material.
(c) In verse 63, Jesus is contrasting the natural or carnal man ("the flesh") with the spiritual or faith-filled man. Read 1 Cor 2:14-3:4 for a good explanation of what Jesus means by "the flesh." Note that Jesus says "my flesh" when discussing the Eucharist. He says "the flesh" when referring to the carnal man -	who will not believe
anything beyond his senses and reason. No Christian believes that Jesus' flesh is "of no avail," for His flesh was the means of our redemption.
(d) Note that the unbelieving disciples leave Jesus after verse 63ï¿½they would not have left at this point if Jesus had assured them that He was only speaking symbolically. This is the only time recorded in the New Testament that any of Jesus' disciples left
Him because they found a doctrine of His too hard to accept. Of the twelve Apostles, apparently only Judas rejected the Eucharist (Jn 6:70-71).
Now read the other Eucharistic Bible passages. Again and again the biblical language indicates the Real Presence of Christ in the Eucharist. Note the strong language of St. Paul in 1 Cor 11:27, "Whoever, therefore, eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of profaning the body and blood of the Lord."
In the Aramaic language that Our Lord spoke, to symbolically "eat the flesh" or "drink the blood" of someone meant to persecute and assault him. See Ps 27:2; Isaiah 9:18-20; Isaiah 49:26; Micah 3:3; 2 Sam 23:l5-17; and Rev 17:6, 16. Thus, if Jesus were only speaking symbolically about eating His flesh and drinking His blood, as Protestants say, then what He really meant was "whoever persecutes and assaults me will have eternal life." This, of course, makes nonsense of the passage.
Consider Christ's use of bread and wine at the Last Supper. Bread and wine are not normal or natural symbols of flesh and blood. Yet in all four Last Supper accounts (Mt 26:26-28; Mk 14:22-24; Lk 22:17-20; 1 Cor 11:23-25) Jesus tells us plainly that "this is my body" and "this is my blood." Never is there a hint that He is speaking symbolically. Either the symbols would have been clearly explained if He were speaking symbolically (which is not the case) or Jesus spoke literally (which is the case).
Occasionally, a non-Catholic will insist that we Catholics, because of our belief
