<p>3. Didn't the Catholic Church become pagan after Constantine became emperor?</p>
<p>Constantine's Christian mother, St. Helena, raised him with Christian beliefs (although he delayed baptism until his deathbed). He defeated the pagan general Maxentius under the standard of the Christian cross in AD 312. The next year Constantine signed the Edict of Milan which officially  ended the Roman persecution of the Church. It is absurd to think he attempted to paganize the Church. In AD 361, the emperor Julian the Apostate launched a persecution of the Church in an attempt to bring back pagan- ism. This would not have been necessary if the Church had become pagan at the time of Constantine (AD 312-337). A careful study of the first 300 years of Christian- ity reveals that Catholic doctrines such as the Eucharist, Apostolic authority, and the Pope as the successor of St. Peter, were believed by Christians from the very beginning. They certainly did not arise after Constantine.</p>
<p>4. Is the Mass really a sacrifice?</p>
<p>Protestants reject the Catholic teaching on the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass for two reasons. They claim the Mass violates many passages in Hebrews which tell us Jesus was only sacrificed once, and that, without the shedding of blood, there is no forgiveness of sins (Heb 9:22, 25, 28, 10:11-12). They think Catholics teach Jesus is sacrificed again at every Mass. They cite Catholic catechisms which teach that in the Mass Jesus is offered in an unbloody manner.</p>
<p>The Catholic Church teaches that the one, all-sufficient, bloody sacrifice of Jesus at Calvary is made present at each Mass in an unbloody manner. Christ is not re-sacrificed at each Mass; rather, the Mass re-presents the one sacrifice of Calvary. Thus, the efficacy (effectiveness) of the Mass comes entirely from the one, bloody sacrifice of Calvary.</p>
<p>The passages referred to in Hebrews compare the many sacrifices of the 01 religion, which could not atone for sin nor reconcile mankind to God, with the one sacrifice of Christ which did atone for all sins and reconcile mankind to God. Hebrews also stresses that the bloody sacrifices of animals in the 01 prefigured the bloody sacrifice of Christ for the remission of sin.</p>
<p>The Mass, also known as the Lord's Supper or the Eucharist, repeats what happened at the Last Supper. At the Last Supper Our Lord turned bread into His body, and said that this body would be offered up (sacrificed) for us. He turned wine into His blood, and said that this blood would be shed (sacrificed) for us. Clearly, at the Last Supper, Jesus made His future sacrifice at Calvary .present. He then commanded His disciples to repeat this mystery. In 1 Cor 11:26, St. Paul tells us that in the celebration of the Eucharist we "proclaim the Lord's death until He comes." Thus, the Last Supper, which made the sacrifice of Calvary</p>
