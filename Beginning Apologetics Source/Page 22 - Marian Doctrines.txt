<p>Many Protestants think Catholics give too much honor to the Blessed Virgin Mary. They reject the four defined doctrines on Our Lady: (1) her Divine Maternity (that she is the Mother of God); (2) her Perpetual Virginity (that she remained a virgin throughout her entire life); (3) her Bodily Assumption; and (4) her Immaculate Conception.</p>
<p>Protestants often want to discuss Marian beliefs immediately. Insist on starting with more basic differences: Apostolic authority, the Eucharist, or the "Bible alone" idea. However, you should be prepared to eventually discuss Marian doctrines.</p>
<p>Before beginning a discussion on the four major doctrines, ask Protestants why they think it is so wrong to honor the mother of our Savior. Remind them that God honored her above all creatures by making her the mother of His Son. In honoring Mary, the Catholic Church is following the example of God Himself. Mary's special privileges were given to her by God, not men.</p>
<p>Read Luke 1:26-56. Note how the Archangel Gabriel shows Mary great honor in his greeting. See how Elizabeth, "filled with the Holy Spirit," calls Mary blessed twice in just four short verses. Under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, Elizabeth gives Our Lady great honor with the words, "And why is this granted to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?"</p>
<p>In verse 48, Our Lady prophesies that all generations will call her blessed. Ask Protestants why they don't call her Blessed Virgin Mary as Catholics do. They call her Mary or perhaps Virgin Mary, but almosi never Blessed Virgin Mary. Let them sec that it is Catholics who are being biblical here and not Protestants.</p>
<p>Once you have established the biblical basis for giving special honor to Our Lady you can begin discussing the four major Marian doctrines. Don't try to deal with all four doctrines at once; this takes a lot of time and can involve many difficulties and side issues.</p>
<div class="well">For apologetic purposes insist on focusing on Mary's title of Mother of God for these reasons:
    <ol type="1">
        <li>This is her first and greatest privilege; the other privileges follow from this one. If they can understand and accept this doctrine, they will grasp the others more easily.</li>
        <li>It is the easiest to defend doctrinally, biblically, and historically.</li>
        <li>The three great pillars of the Reformation�Luther, Calvin, and Zwingli�all accepted this doctrine wholeheartedly.</li>
    </ol>
</div></p>
<p>Most Protestants are shocked to learn thai although the founders of Protestantism rejected many Catholic doctrines, they insisted on honoring Mary as Mother of God and Ever-Virgin (see Appendix 2, page 24).</p>
<p>DOCTRINAL BASIS</p>
<p>All Christians believe that Jesus was born of the Blessed Virgin Mary. They also believe that although Jesus has two natures (one divine and one human), He is one Divine Person. Since this one person was born of Mary, she truly is the Mother of the one Divine Person.: in short, the Mother of God.</p>
<p>If a person denies that Mary is the Mother of God, whether he realizes it or not, he is denying the Incarnation. He is saying either that Jesus is not God, or that Jesus is two persons�one human and one divine. Protestants ask: "How can Mary, a creature, be the mother of God the Creator?" We answer that when the eternal Son of God became man, He assumed a human nature, which made it possible for Him to be born of a woman just as we were.</p>
<p>BIBLICAL BASIS</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Luke 1:43: Elizabeth calls her "mother of my Lord." In the NT, "Lord" refers only to God.</li>
        <li>Mt 1:23: "Behold, a virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and His name shall be called Emmanuel' (which means, God is with us)."</li>
        <li>Luke 1:35: "the child to be born will be called holy, the Son of God."</li>
        <li>Gal 4:4: "But when the time had fully come, God sent forth His Son, born of woman."</li>
    </ul>
<p>EARLY CHURCH FATHERS</p>
<p>"For our God, Jesus Christ, was conceived by Mary in accord with God's plan.. "26 (St. Ignatius, AD 110).</p>
<p>"The Virgin Mary, ... being obedient to His word, received from an angel the glad tidings that she would bear God"27 (St. Irenaeus, AD 180-199).</p>

<p>Remind Protestants that if they look at Church history they will find that Mary's title of Mother of God was not rejected until AD 429. In that year, a bishop named Nestorius promoted the heresy that Jesus was two distinct persons , and that Mary was only the mother of the human person. In AD 431, the Council of Ephesus condemned this heresy. It did not surface again in Christianity until after the Reformation. Notice how a correct belief about Mary leads to a correct belief about Jesus.</p>
<p>In regard to the other three Marian doctrines, biblical passages in support of them are not explicit28 and we have to rely on Apostolic Tradition and the teaching authority of the Church.</p>
<p>Assumption. The doctrine doesn't tell us if Mary died; it merely states that after the completion of her life, she was taken body and soul into heaven. Note that Elijah and Enoch were assumed into heaven, just as the righteous will be at the end of time (see Gn 5:24; 2 Kg 2:11; 1 Thess 4:17; Heb 11:5). Why is it hard to believe that God gave His mother this privilege? No city ever claimed her body. There is no record of her relics or remains anywhere.</p>
<p>Immaculate Conception. The doctrine doesn't say that Mary didn't need a savior. Like all the OT saints, Mary was saved through the anticipated merits of Jesus. Mary's salvation was simply more perfect. By God's grace, she was preserved from sin at her conception. In contrast, we are cleansed from sin after our birth.</p>
<p>Perpetual Virginity. Mary's perpetual virginity was not challenged the early Church until the time of St. Jerome (around AD 400). This doctrine was not rejected by the founders of Protestantism. Note that "brothers" in the Bible can also mean "relatives." If Jesus had blood brothers, He would not have entrusted Mary to John, but one of them. Two so-called "brothers" of Jesus (Mt 13:55)�James and Joseph�are identified as sons of another Mary, the wife Clopas (compare Mt 27:56 and Jn 19:25).</p>
