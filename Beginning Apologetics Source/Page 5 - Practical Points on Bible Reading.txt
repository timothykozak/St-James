    <li>Choose a good translation of the Bible. The three versions approved for liturgical use in this country are the 1970 New American Bible (NAB), the Jerusalem Bible, and the Revised Standard Version Catholic Edition (RSVCE). We recommend the RS VCE, with the NAB as a back-up.</li>
    <li>Get a Bible that is comfortable to read. Large print is generally best for most people. Those who have difficulty reading should get giant print.</li>
    <li>Use Bible tabs and a soft cover Bible. This allows you to find verses quickly. Remember that time is critical in apologetics. You don't want to spend your 15 minutes looking up a Bible passage. Practice, and become proficient at quickly finding verses.</li>
    <li>Pick a Bible that has newspaper-type columns. These are easier to read, and make passages easier to identify. Choose a Bible that has the cross-references and footnotes on the same page as this saves time. It is also helpful if your Bible has a dictionary and doctrinal index at the end.</li>
    <li>Avoid arguments over translations. You can almost always defend the Catholic position from any translation. (There are exceptions: for example, the Jehovah's Witnesses have a very mangled translation called the New World Translation, which you should avoid.)</li>
 1 See our booklet, Beginning Apologetics 7. How to Read the Bibleï¿½A Catholic Introduction to Interpreting & Defending Sacred Scripture for practical tips and principles to help you read and interpret the Bible correctly.</li>
    <li>Stay away from arguments over the Greek or Hebrew meanings of the words.2 Splitting hairs over the precise meaning of the original Greek and Hebrew words is often used as a diversionary tactic by non-Catholics. Emphasize that the best Greek and Hebrew scholars were involved in giving us the standard modem versions and that you are willing to use any of these. Stress that doctrinal differences are almost never due to bad translations. We have excellent translations in our time, both Catholic and Protestant. The differences arise over what the words, accurately translated, mean. What we need are good cross-references, Church history, and reason.</li>
    <li>Underline or highlight verses and make notes in your Bible. Your study Bible is not a decoration or family heirloom.</li
    <li>Don't try to memorize exact chapter and verse, except for a few critical passages. Memorize the chapter or chapters. If you have highlighted well, the doctrinally important verse will stand out immediately when you get within a chapter or two of it.</li>

When you read your Bible,
remember these three points:
(1) Highlight
(2) Make notes
(3) Memorize
...And Don't Forget Your TABS!
2Obviously, a knowledge of Greek and Hebrew can be very useful for studying the Bible and refuting misinterpretations. However, you can be an effective apologist without knowing any biblical languages.
