<p>Mary's perpetual virginity. The Hebrew and Aramaic languages spoken by Christ and His disciples do not have separate words for "brother," "cousin," or "near-relative." For example, in the original Hebrew, Lot is called Abraham's "brother" (Gen 14:14). Yet we know that Lot was Abraham's nephew (Gen 11:27). The Jews used the word "brother" for all kinds of relationships, not just for "blood-brothers" (see 1 Cor 15:6, Mt 23:8, Acts 7:23).</p>
<p>6. Why do Catholics believe that Mary was assumed body and soul into heaven? Scripture does not record the Assumption of Mary, so we depend on Apostolic Tradition for our belief. However, the Assumption is not anti-scriptural. In fact, Scripture gives every indication that such a thing could occur. Consider the unusual ends of certain righteous people: Enoch was taken to heaven without dying (Heb 11:5); and Elijah was whisked into heaven by a fiery chariot (2 King 2:11). Matthew 27:52 suggests a bodily assumption before the Second Coming, and many Protestants believe in the "rapture" based on 1 Thess 4:17 and 1 Cor 15:52. Mary is simply the first to be "raptured."</p>
<p>7. Why did the Catholic Church invent the dogmas of the Immaculate Conception in 1854, and the Bodily Assumption in 1950?</p>
<p>The Catholic Church officially defined the doctrines in 1854 and 1950, respectively. She did not "invent" them at that time, any more than she "invented" the doctrine of the Trinity when she officially defined it in 325, or "invented" the New Testament when she officially determined the canon in 393 and 397. The Catholic Church was merely codifying a belief which always existed in the Church, and was expressed in th writings of the early Church Fathers.</p>
<p>8. Are Catholics required to believe in the Immaculate Conception and Assumption of Mary?</p>
<p>Yes. All Catholics are required to believ everything that Christ's Church teaches Officially defined doctrines are calle dogmas, which every Catholic must accept in order to be a faithful Catholic. When these two doctrines were infallibly defined, the became binding dogmas of faith.</p>
<p>9. Are Catholics required to believe in thd Church-approved apparitions of Mary, such as Fatima and Lourdes?</p>
<p>No. Catholics have the assurance of th Church that these revelations are orthodo and worthy of belief, but they are nc doctrine or an addition to public revelatio (which ended with the death of the la Apostle). Therefore a Catholic is free t accept or reject these officially approve apparitions.</p>
<p>10. Why do Catholics pray to Mary?  1 Tim 2:5 says "there is ONE mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus."</p>
<p>Catholics ask for Mary's intercession for th same reason that we ask for a fello Christian's intercession: "the prayer of righteous man has great power in its effects (James 5:16). Because Jesus is the on mediator between earth and heaven, intercede for one another as members ( Christ's body. If fellow saints praying for on earth do not destroy Christ's role as tF one mediator, neither do glorified saini praying for us in heaven. Mary is the greate saint. Why wouldn't we seek her powerful intercession?</p>
