On January 24, 1999, Pope John Paul II issued a "call to arms" for Catholics to aggressively confront the challenge of Protestant evangelism. Addressing more than a million people in Mexico City, the Holy Father urged Catholics to ignore the seductions of "fallacious and novel ideologies" and to spread the word of the Church:
Don't fail to respond to the Master who calls. Follow him to become, like the apostles, fishers of men. Make Christ's word reach those who still don't know him. Have the courage to bear witness to the gospel on the streets and in the town squares, in the valleys and mountains of this nation!
The Catholic Church today is being challenged vigorously by non-Catholic evangelizers. Unfortunately, many Catholics feel ill-prepared to defend their faith in the face of these attacks.  We hope this booklet will give Catholics the basic tools to effectively answer the challenges of the many religious groups that come knocking on our doors and to correct some of the misconceptions non-Catholics have about the Catholic Church and its teachings.

This sacred Synod earnestly exhorts laymen, each according to his natural gifts and learning, to be  more diligent in doing their part to explain and defend Christian principles.
