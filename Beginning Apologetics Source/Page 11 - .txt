versions of these books which the Septuagint supposedly translated into Greek.'
Since the Christian Church had used the Septuagint from the beginning, it simply ignored the decisions of later rabbinic Judaism and continued to use the Septuagint. When the Church officially determined which books comprise the canon of the Bible (Councils of Hippo, AD 393, and Carthage, AD 397), it approved the 46 books of the Septuagint as the canon for the OT. For sixteen centuries the Christian OT was a matter of uncontested faith. Each of the seven rejected books is quoted by early Church Fathers as "Scripture" or as "inspired," right along with the undisputed books. 14
In 1529, Martin Luther proposed to adopt the 39-book canon used by rabbinic Judaism as the 01 canon. Luther justified his decision to delete seven books from the OT by appealing to St. Jerome who, around AD 400, had expressed concerns that these Greek books had no Hebrew counterparts. However, research into the Dead Sea Scrolls found at Qumran has discovered ancient Hebrew copies of some of the disputed books, 15 making their rejection unsupportable on those grounds. The principle reason Luther seems to have opposed the additional books of the Christian OT is that they taught doctrines he did not like, such as praying for the dead (2 Maccabees 12:42-45).
But here is the real question: Which OT would you rather use�the 01 used by Jesus, the NT writers and the early Church, or the OT used by later Jews who had rejected Christ and persecuted Christians?
If your Bible includes the seven books, you follow Jesus and the early Church. If your Bible omits the seven books, you follow non-Christian rabbis and Martin Luther�a man who wanted to throw out even more books (James, Esther, Revelation), and who deliberately added the word "alone" to Sacred Scripture in his German translation of Romans 3:28.
The New Testament (NT)
The first word of the NT was written about AD 50 (1 Thess), the last word between AD 90-100 (Rev), for a total of 27 books, all of which are accepted as canonical and inspired by Catholics and Protestants alike. The question is, who determined the NT canon of inspired books? The Bible didn't fall from heaven pre-printed, so where did we get it? How do we know we can trust every book?



13 The rabbinic Jews used four criteria to determine their canon. They accepted only those books which were: (1) written in Hebrew; (2) in conformity with the Torah; (3) older than the time of Ezra (c. 400 BC); and (4) written in Palestine.
14 Among these Fathers are Polycarp, Irenaeus, Clement, and Cyprian. For a collection of patristic quotations from each of the disputed books, see "The Fathers Know Best: Old Testa ment Canon" in the October 1993 issue of This Rock magazine (Volume 4, No. 10) 25-27.
