# My additions
# Back in mid 2024, somehow BlueHost added all kinds of RewriteRules for weebly and
# for mobile phones.  This caused a problem with the website showing
# stjamesmcconnelsville.org/stbernarbeverly instead of stbernardbeverly.org
# It also rerouted mobile phones to /mobil which displayed an empty site.
# I got in touch with BlueHost twice, each time spending a half hour with no
# resolution.  I moved all of the .htaccess files to /old.  I then took
# .htaccess and deleted all of the weebly code.  That seems to have fixed the
# problem.  I am not sure how all of the weebly commands got in there
#
# The following was an effort to manually redirect the addon domains.
# It did not work correctly and was not necessary.
# RewriteEngine On
# RewriteEngine Off
# RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^(www\.)?stbernardbeverly\.org$
# RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/stbernardbeverly
# RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://stjamesmcconnelsville.org/stbernardbeverly/$1 [L]
